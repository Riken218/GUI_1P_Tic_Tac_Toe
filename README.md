Tkinter GUI Tic-Tac-Toe with an "AI"

Straightforward Computer Player "AI" that plays agains the player.

Let me know about any bugs or improvements I can make to this. I'm pretty proud of it all things considered since it's the first truly made-for-public-reading code I've written in a very long time.

Other than that, I hope you enjoy wasting time with it at least as much as I have!
